# Odata server using Jaystack 


I tried to build my a OData V4 Server using jaystack (https://github.com/jaystack/odata-v4-server) with postgres https://github.com/jaystack/odata-v4-server-pgsql-example
the project is working, However, I decide to abandon it since I got too many errors with the parser and TypeError.
